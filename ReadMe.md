## Introduction

This repository aims to provide efficient and well-documented solutions to common DSA problems using JavaScript. Each solution includes detailed explanations and comments to help you understand the underlying concepts and approaches.

## List of Problems

### Arrays

1. **Two Sum**
   - Problem: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.
   - Solution: [twoSum.js](./arrays/twoSum.js)

2. **Maximum Subarray**
   - Problem: Find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
   - Solution: [maxSubArray.js](./arrays/maxSubArray.js)

### Linked Lists

1. **Reverse Linked List**
   - Problem: Reverse a singly linked list.
   - Solution: [reverseLinkedList.js](./linked-lists/reverseLinkedList.js)

2. **Merge Two Sorted Lists**
   - Problem: Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new sorted list.
   - Solution: [mergeTwoSortedLists.js](./linked-lists/mergeTwoSortedLists.js)

### Stacks and Queues

1. **Valid Parentheses**
   - Problem: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
   - Solution: [validParentheses.js](./stacks-queues/validParentheses.js)

2. **Min Stack**
   - Problem: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
   - Solution: [minStack.js](./stacks-queues/minStack.js)

### Trees and Graphs

1. **Binary Tree Inorder Traversal**
   - Problem: Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
   - Solution: [binaryTreeInorderTraversal.js](./trees-graphs/binaryTreeInorderTraversal.js)

2. **Clone Graph**
   - Problem: Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.
   - Solution: [cloneGraph.js](./trees-graphs/cloneGraph.js)

### Sorting and Searching

1. **Merge Sort**
   - Problem: Implement merge sort algorithm.
   - Solution: [mergeSort.js](./sorting-searching/mergeSort.js)

2. **Binary Search**
   - Problem: Implement binary search algorithm.
   - Solution: [binarySearch.js](./sorting-searching/binarySearch.js)

### Dynamic Programming

1. **Climbing Stairs**
   - Problem: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
   - Solution: [climbingStairs.js](./dynamic-programming/climbingStairs.js)

2. **Longest Common Subsequence**
   - Problem: Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
   - Solution: [longestCommonSubsequence.js](./dynamic-programming/longestCommonSubsequence.js)
